This project provide you a simple C++ platform for TAKE6 1v1 AI debugging. 

## Rule of Game

The rule of TAKE6 here is still somewhat different to the generally used one. 
 
+ One match may contains several games.
+ One match won't stop until an agent's nimmts reachs 66 after some game ends. 
+ At the beginning of one game, each agent has 10 random cards. 
+ Everytime when a game ends all cards will be shuffled.
+ You are able to choose the stack to reset when your played card's point is the smallest.
